## <mark style="color:green;">**stateless widget**</mark>

&#x20;is a widget that does not maintain any state of its own. It is immutable, meaning that its properties cannot change after it has been created. Stateless widgets are used when the user interface is static and does not need to update or redraw based on changes over time.

## <mark style="color:green;">**`Scaffold(webpage এর কাঠামো)`**</mark>

&#x20;is a widget that provides a basic structure for creating a standard app layout. It is often used as the main container for the content of your app and offers a range of built-in functionalities that make it easy to design a basic visual framework for an app.

#### Features of `Scaffold`:

* **`appBar`**: Provides a space at the top of the app for a title, navigation icons, and other actions.
* **`body`**: The main content area of the screen where you place widgets.
* **`floatingActionButton`**: A circular button that floats above the body and is commonly used for primary actions, like adding a new item.
* **`drawer`**: A slide-in panel from the left (or right, depending on locale) that can contain navigation links and options.
* **`bottomNavigationBar`**: A bottom bar that allows for easy navigation between different sections of the app.
* **`snackBar`**: Temporary messages or alerts that appear at the bottom of the screen.
* **`persistentFooterButtons`**: Buttons that remain fixed at the bottom of the screen, usually for quick actions.
