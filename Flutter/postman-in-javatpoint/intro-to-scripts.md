# Intro to Scripts

## In Postman Scripts are the lines of code that allow you to automate an API test. It offers you to write pre-request and test scripts.

## In Postman, **pre-request scripts** are used to execute custom JavaScript code before a request is sent.

* Before sending a request, a pre-request script will run and,
* After receiving a response, **test scripts** will run.
