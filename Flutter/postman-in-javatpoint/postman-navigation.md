### 3. Builder or Request section



* **Params**

This option is used to write the parameters of the request. These parameters include key values and descriptions.



* **Authorization**

The authorization process is required to access the APIs. This process verifies whether you have permission from the server to access the data you want.



* **Headers**

An HTTP request header is the additional data that is required to send along with the request. This header information is required for proper two-direction communication between the client and the server.



* **Pre-request script**

These are written in JavaScript, and as the name suggests, these are executed before sending the request. Generally, these scripts are for setting the environment and ensuring that the request is running in the right environment.





### 4. Response section

The API responses which are sent back from the server are shown in the response window. These are generated after you send an API request to the server. As we have not sent any request, so there is no response in our case.
