## create flutter without iOS and Linux  platform:



### Step : Remove iOS and Windows Platforms



```dart
flutter config --no-enable-ios
flutter config --no-enable-windows

```



## Step 3: Check Supported Platforms

```dart
flutter devices

```

* Start coding your Flutter app.
* Use the `flutter run` command to run the app on your desired platforms (e.g., Android, web, Linux).



## if you later decide to re-enable a platform, use the corresponding configuration commands:

```dart
flutter config --enable-ios
flutter config --enable-windows

```
